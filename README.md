The pitch: Have an iOS 8 extension with Stars to rate the current session during the conference

The plus: In the app itself show the list of Sessions with they average rating

The catch: All in Swift!


(Notes)

• JSON?
• Find out how to have the Sessions (imported from JSON?) in the Public Cloud Kit DB
• Get the list of sessions and schedule local notifications with userinfo allowing to show them in Today extension
• Try that in a simple View Controller
• Rate the current session (The only part working in the extension) - Is there a way to know you run in the extension?!
• In the "full app" show how many ratings for this session and the average rating
• Check if Cloud Kit can tell you when the Public DB changed? Else just refresh every 10 seconds

• Step 2: Submit your Twitter Handle
• Step 3: Choose for people having more than 1 handle
